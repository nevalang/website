Unfortunately documentation isn't finished. We haven't covered a lot of stuff including interfaces and dependency injection, array ports and streams, error handling, working with structures and enums and a lot more.

Please refer to the [examples](https://github.com/nevalang/neva/tree/main/examples) in the Nevalang's git repository. Meanwile we will continue to improve documentation.

As always, PRs are welcome. Also feel free to ask questions in the [community](/community).
