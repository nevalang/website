title: A Program That Does Nothing
weight: 1
---

Here is the smallest program in Nevalang that compiles. It does absolutely nothing, but by looking at it, you can learn a lot about Nevalang.

```neva
component Main(start any) (stop any) {
    net { :start -> :stop }
}
```

Let's break down what's written here.

A Nevalang program consists of _components_ that send _messages_ to each other through _ports_, but ports cannot be connected randomly. Each port has its own _data type_, and when we connect one port to another, the compiler checks if they are _compatible_. Otherwise, it throws an error.

It states that there is a "Main" component (every component has a name), with two ports - one for input - `start` - and one for output - `stop`. The data type of both ports is `any` - a universal data type, saying "I am compatible with any type of data."

```neva
Main (start any) (stop any)
```

Next, we see a block of curly braces `{}` and inside another one with the keyword `net`.

```neva
{
    net { :start -> :stop }
}
```

Ports are the _interface_ of a component, but in addition to the interface, a component also needs a _body_ - code that describes what exactly the component does, what work it performs. In this case, the curly braces are the body, and `net` is the _network_ - the computational scheme of the component.

In Nevalang, programming is _flow-based_, and instead of controlling the flow of execution, as in conventional languages, we control the flow of data. We don't call functions, don't execute instructions; we just route messages from one place to another, thus creating a graph that describes how data flows through the program. That's why such programming is called flow-based.

In this case, we see that data flows directly from the input port `start` to the output port `stop`.

```
:start -> :stop
```

In other words, our Main component does nothing. It just lets data pass through itself without having any impact on the external world. Essentially, it could be called a bypass, but in a Nevalang program, there must always be at least one `Main` component (we'll understand why later).
